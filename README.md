I developed a website called "SUNIL ORNAMENTS" for my father's shop. This website features the capability to generate and print invoices, 
and hence reduces the manual effort of making bills. 
Here, I used :- 
Spring Boot (Framework) → Backend 
HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap (Framework) → Frontend
MYSQL → Database
